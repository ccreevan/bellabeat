# bellabeat

BBellabeat case study for data analysis.

Written in R in Rstudio. Libraries used were tidyverse, lubridate, and prettydoc.

HTML file is the final documentation output in a pretty format. R codes are the working files to test and run output. Rmd is the markdown file.

CSV files used are located here: https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao

Note the working directories may cause issues if you do not change or create them to match the locations in the code or markdown files, be sure to change or create the working directory if you want to work with the data above.
